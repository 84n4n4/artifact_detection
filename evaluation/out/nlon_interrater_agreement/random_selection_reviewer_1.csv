1375,1,"Hi! We have an issue that a container stops responding on network (mostly http) requests with a connection reset by peer, shown on traefik logs. If I try that request inside container it works perfect, but not from another container or from any node. I've reviewed base node image with up-to-date network/provider drivers (aws with ixgbevf and ena), updated cluster (up to 1.7.5, same stable version from kops) and traefik up-to-date (as loadb level7). The metrics shows a flat chart on cpu and mem while they do not respond. Killing the unresponsive pod obviously makes it work again. Usually it responds again after some minutes. It seems to happens to most of hpa or frontend containers. Any thoughts? Thanks.",1376,lines.10k.cfo.sample.2000 - Kubernetes (Slackarchive.io).csv,1.0,1.0,False
